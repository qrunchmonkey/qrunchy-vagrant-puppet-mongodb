_I just wanted to run MogoDB in a VM._

If do too, just make sure you've got [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) installed. I used Vagrant 1.9.1 and VirtualBox 5.0.30, but other versions will likely work.

Then, checkout or download this repo somewhere, `cd` into that directory, and then `vagrant up`

### The Whole Story

If you want to [follow along with how I got to this point](HOW-TO.md) (perhaps you're reading this in the future, and it no longer works), I tried to document the steps I took and the challenges I encountered. Good luck, and happy hacking.
