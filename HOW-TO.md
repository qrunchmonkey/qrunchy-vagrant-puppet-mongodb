##I Have No Idea What I'm Doing.


####Step 1: Start.

Make a directory: `mkdir ubuntu1604-mongodb` and `cd ubuntu1604-mongodb`
(Optional) We're going to want to use git. `git init`

####Step 2: Vagrant init
type `vagrant init`

Now we have a default `Vagrantfile` with all kinds of stuff we don't need!
